# Beginner-focused practica

## Event Overview
We plan to offer this practica **on a three-month trial basis** in order to assess its value to the tango community
* Working name: Guided practica with tango mentors
* Goal: Provide an opportunity for beginners to practice class materials with peers and mentors in a fun, friendly environment.
* Expectation: participants are expected to learn both roles
* Principal mentors: Toby, WaiLing, Toshi, Emilen
* Supporting mentors: TBD
* Format: Pre-practica class (1 hour) + guided practica
* Frequency: every Thursday from 7:30 pm to 10:00 pm 

## Pre-milonga class 
We will focus on reinforcing the tango fundamentals in the class, rather than teaching steps. 
* Instructors: the lead instructor will be chosen from the principal mentors on a rotation basis and others assist
* Participants: Intended for Intro and beginner students from Sunday and Tuesday classes, but open to the public 
* To improve their understanding of the fundamentals, the participants are expected to do both roles.
* If we have enough participants and instructors, we may split the class into two levels

## Guided practica
* 3-song tandas with cortina in T-T-V-T-T-M format
* Mentors will be available to answer questions, suggest exercises, and help with problem-solving.
* Mentors will not dance with participants or other mentors for personal entertainment
* Mentors will dance with the participants for mentoring purposes only (1 or 2 songs)
