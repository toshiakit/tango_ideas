# Beginner-focused practica

Beginners learn new materials week after week in the class, but they need more time to practice and incorporate what they were taught because the class time is never sufficient to master the materials. For this reason, the focus should be on practica, rather than on the class, and the class should be about reinforcing the fundamentals. However, in most practicas, people just do social dancing rather than working on the materials. We hope to provide an opportunity for beginners to practice class materials with peers and mentors in a fun, friendly environment.

## Event Overview
We plan to offer this practica **on a three-month trial basis** in order to assess the interest in and value to the tango community
* Working name: Guided practica with tango mentors
* Goal: Provide an opportunity for beginners to practice class materials with peers and mentors in a fun, friendly environment.
* Expectation: participants are expected to learn both roles
* Principal mentors: Toby, WaiLing, Toshi, Emilen
* Supporting mentors: TBD
* Format: pre-practica class (1 hour) + guided practica
* Frequency: every Thursday from 7:30 pm to 10:00 pm (we may have planned cancellation in resource constraints)

## Pre-milonga class 
**Focus on fundamentals, not the steps. Less time talking, more time trying. Make the class interactive** 
* Instructors: the lead instructor will be chosen from the principal mentors on a rotation basis and others assist
  * If Toby and Wailing teach one week, Toshi and Emilen assist that week, and Toshi and Emilen teach next week as Tony and WaiLing assist.
  * This is meant to reduce the burden on principal mentors and learn from one another on instructions - what works and doesn't work, what changes we want to make. 
* Participants: Intended for Intro and beginner students from Sunday and Tuesday classes, but open to the public
* The participants are expected to do both roles to improve their understanding of the fundamentals.
* We will focus on reinforcing fundamentals, not the steps. We will use exercises to encourage self-discovery from trial and error.   
* If we have enough participants and mentors, we may split the class into two levels

## Guided practica
More focus on learning and practicing than social dancing
* 3-song tandas with cortina in T-T-V-T-T-M format
* Participants are expected to rotate partners for each tanda - no consecutive tandas with the same person.
* Mentors will be available to answer questions, suggest exercises, and help with problem-solving.
* Mentors will not dance with participants or other mentors for personal entertainment
* Mentors will dance with the participants for mentoring purposes only (1 or 2 songs)

## Tango fundamentals
We will focus on these topics every week. 
* Social codes & tango history
* Connection & embrace
* posture & stability
* Walking, tango music & improvisation
* Leading & following
* Floor navigation

## Optional materials
The following topics may be covered when appropriate.  
* 8-count basic to the cross
* Cross-system
* Ochos and pivots
* Molinete (Giro)

## Exercise ideas
* Connect walking to music: introduce different orchestras (Di Sarli, D'Arienzo, Troilo, Pugliese, etc.) and how to match waking to the music, the importance of pauses - this can be solo exercises (solo dancing) as par Olga Basio
* Connection exercise by Corina and Octavio.
  * What is the sensation you get when you establish a connection? How long does it take to establish a connection? Place your hand on the upper chest of your partner and try to move your partner side to side, forward and back. Can you maintain that sensation when you move around your partner? What does the partner need to do to maintain that sensation? What do you need to do to move together? Hint = you need to move your partner before you move. Can you find the same sensation when you change it to the practice embrace or tango embrace?
  * Finding the connection with the floor. Jump and land and see what your body does (the tailbone is out). What is the posture? How comfortable and stable do you feel?
  * Stand on one foot with eyes closed. How long can you stand?
* Leading and following exercise by Paula and Lucas.
  * In front of your partner, look towards your partner's chest (not on the floor), and propose the walk by using a circular motion (go backward to the floor to move forward, go forward to the floor to move backward). If you don't feel the proposal, don't move. 
* What does it mean to "arrive"? Corina de la Rosa's exercise - place your hand on the cheek on the side of your standing leg and take a step - notice the alignment of the hand and your new standing leg.
* Social codes - We need to respect one another - Invite people to dance by cabeceo (so that people can reject without saying no). Once agreed, you are expected to dance for the whole tanda, but you can end a tanda early by saying "thank you" at the end of a song (no need to put up with a bad experience). Don't say thank you until the tanda is finished. Don't talk during a song. Report inappropriate behavior (even if you are not 100% sure) to the teachers or organizers.
* Tango history & culture - Argentinians like to hug -> close embrace, is the norm. But not a tight squeeze, more a comfortable enclosing hug. Good embrace attracts more dances. Women couldn't go to milongas by themselves, and men had to practice among themselves until they were good enough to go to milonga. Tango almost died when rock became more popular. Old milongueros kept the tradition and inspired a new generation - Miguel Balmaceda, Pepito Avellaneda, Mingo Pugliese, Puppy Castello, Antonio Todaro, Tete Rusconi, Carlos Gavito, ... Then came tango nuevo - Gustavo Naveira, Fabian Salas and Chicho Frumboli - but now tango salon or villa Urquiza style is more common. However, people often associate tango with what they see on TV - that's stage tango and not social tango.
* Leading & following: "Leader" and "follower" are misleading terms because you need to follow in order to lead and followers influence the leader based on how they execute the move. Doing steps != leading.
