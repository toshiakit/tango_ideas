# Beginner-focused practica

## Event Overview
We plan to offer this practica **on a three-month trial basis** in order to assess the interest in and value to the tango community
* Working name: Guided practica with tango mentors
* Goal: Provide an opportunity for beginners to practice class materials with peers and mentors in a fun, friendly environment.
* Expectation: participants are expected to learn both roles
* Principal mentors: Toby, WaiLing, Toshi, Emilen
* Supporting mentors: TBD
* Format: pre-practica class (1 hour) + guided practica
* Frequency: every Thursday from 7:30 pm to 10:00 pm (we may have planned cancellation in resource constraints)

## Pre-milonga class 
**Focus on fundamentals, not the steps. Less time talking, more time trying.** 
* Instructors: the lead instructor will be chosen from the principal mentors on a rotation basis and others assist
* Participants: Intended for Intro and beginner students from Sunday and Tuesday classes, but open to the public
* The participants are expected to do both roles to improve their understanding of the fundamentals.
* We will focus on reinforcing fundamentals, not the steps. We will use exercises to encourage self-discovery from trial and error.   
* If we have enough participants and mentors, we may split the class into two levels

## Guided practica
More focus on learning and practicing than social dancing
* 3-song tandas with cortina in T-T-V-T-T-M format
* Mentors will be available to answer questions, suggest exercises, and help with problem-solving.
* Mentors will not dance with participants or other mentors for personal entertainment
* Mentors will dance with the participants for mentoring purposes only (1 or 2 songs)

## Tango fundamentals
We will focus on these topics every week. 
* Social codes & tango history
* Connection & embrace
* Walking & the tango music
* Leading & following
* Floor navigation

## Optional materials
The following topics may be covered when appropriate.
