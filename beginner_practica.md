# Beginner-focused practica

Beginners learn new materials week after week in the class, but they need more time to practice and incorporate what they were taught because the class time is never sufficient to master the materials. For this reason, the focus should be on practica, rather than on the class, and the class should be about reinforcing the fundamentals. 

## Event Overview
We plan to offer this practica **on a three-month trial basis** in order to assess the interest in and value to the tango community
* Working name: Guided practica with tango mentors
* Goal: Provide an opportunity for beginners to practice class materials with peers and mentors in a fun, friendly environment.
* Expectation: participants are expected to learn both roles
* Principal mentors: Toby, WaiLing, Toshi, Emilen
* Supporting mentors: TBD
* Format: pre-practica class (1 hour) + guided practica
* Frequency: every Thursday from 7:30 pm to 10:00 pm (we may have planned cancellation in resource constraints)

## Pre-milonga class 
**Focus on fundamentals, not the steps. Less time talking, more time trying.** 
* Instructors: the lead instructor will be chosen from the principal mentors on a rotation basis and others assist
  * If Toby and Wailing teach one week, Toshi and Emilen assist that week, and Toshi and Emilen teach next week as Tony and WaiLing assist.
  * This is meant to reduce the burden on principal mentors and learn from one another on instructions - what works and doesn't work, what changes we want to make. 
* Participants: Intended for Intro and beginner students from Sunday and Tuesday classes, but open to the public
* The participants are expected to do both roles to improve their understanding of the fundamentals.
* We will focus on reinforcing fundamentals, not the steps. We will use exercises to encourage self-discovery from trial and error.   
* If we have enough participants and mentors, we may split the class into two levels

## Guided practica
More focus on learning and practicing than social dancing
* 3-song tandas with cortina in T-T-V-T-T-M format
* Mentors will be available to answer questions, suggest exercises, and help with problem-solving.
* Mentors will not dance with participants or other mentors for personal entertainment
* Mentors will dance with the participants for mentoring purposes only (1 or 2 songs)

## Tango fundamentals
We will focus on these topics every week. 
* Social codes & tango history
* Connection & embrace
* posture & stability
* Walking, tango music & improvisation
* Leading & following
* Floor navigation

## Optional materials
The following topics may be covered when appropriate.  
* 8-count basic to the cross
* Cross-system
* Ochos and pivots
* Molinete (Giro)
